# Targeted-bank-telemarketing

Salesmen attempt to sell their bank’s product offerings by cold calling people in the population.
This project analyzes a dataset of instances of such interactions between salesmen attempting to
sell a particular fixed deposit product over a 3 year period of varying macroeconomic conditions to
people in the population. It aims to offer a strategy to increase the success rate of attracting
potential clients to the bank’s product offerings using techniques in Excel and R.
